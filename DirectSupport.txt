DirectSupport - A DirectChat hook that utilizes private channels to allows "helpers" and ordinary players to converse privately for help.
Throughout this documentation, arguments enclosed in <> are necessary, whereas arguments in [] are optional. If a ... is place in an argument (e.g <message ...>), then that argument extends for the rest of the command, including any spaces.
